Description
The theatre is getting popular, and the customers started complaining that it's not practical that the program stops after buying one ticket. Let's add a menu that will allow them to buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement when needed.

Objectives
At the start, your program should read two positive integer numbers that represent the number of rows and seats in each row. Then, it should print a menu with the following three items:

Show the seats should print the current seating arrangement. The empty seats should be marked with an S symbol, and taken seats are marked with a B symbol.
Buy a ticket should read the seat coordinates from the input and print the ticket price like in the previous stage. After that, the chosen seat should be marked with a B when the item Show the seats is called.
Exit should stop the program.
Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Enter the number of rows:
> 7
Enter the number of seats in each row:
> 7
